# Comparison

This repo is meant to compare different ways to style components.

## Scope

Our goal here is to make the same component using various frameworks to compare features and implementations. We're going to do a slightly deeper dive with a selected number of frameworks, to see how they scale past a simple example.

For a complete reference of all the available frameworks see [MicheleBertoli/css-in-js](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js)

We have issues open for the frameworks we're planning on implementing; if you think there's a strong case for adding one that's not on our list please open an issue to let us know!
